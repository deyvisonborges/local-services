# VMware Log Intelligence Demo

You need to have your `HOST` environment variable available for docker to make this work.  
It's not enough that you can read its value in your shell, it needs to be exported as well.
Please run `export HOST` or hardcode the `NODE_NAME` in the docker-compose file.

You also need to set your API key: `export LOGS_API_KEY='secret'`
